# Gakun

Gakun is a SSH key manager where you can manage and switch your SSH key easily. Instead of managing the keys in separated directory like [skm](https://github.com/TimothyYe/skm), Gakun manages the SSH keys directly within the `~/.ssh` directory, as it should be. So, whenever you want to go back with manual management, you are still having a great control over your keys.
